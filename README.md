# dimetime-saver
This chrome extension reminds you how much your time is worth, helping you find the right balance between saving money and your hourly wage. I made it because I tend to waste too much time hunting for deals. It will send you a reminder about how much your time is worth if you spend more than twenty minutes on a shopping website for basic necessities (e.g. Walmart, Target, Amazon).
