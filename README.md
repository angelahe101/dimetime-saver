# dimetime-saver
This chrome extension reminds you how much your time is worth in relation to your wage, helping you find the right balance between saving money and your hourly wage. It will send you a reminder about how much your time is worth if you spend more than twenty minutes on a shopping website for basic necessities (e.g. Walmart, Target, Amazon). It calculates your time's value by dividing your hourly wage by three. This extension prevents you from spending too much time hunting for deals that are not really worth your time. 

You can input your hourly wage and currency symbol in the popup.
